### About the data
...
Wandering around [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), I was looking for ideas on how to approach my SQL data cleaning project. I found the [CarPrice_Assignment](https://www.kaggle.com/goyalshalini93/car-data) dataset in another user’s notebook. It’s a great dataset to practice on because it contains inconsistencies that a data analyst would happen upon in a work project. 

### Real-world situation

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and visualizations.
